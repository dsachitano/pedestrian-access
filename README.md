# An experiment on pedestrian access

This is an experiment I did that looks at some of the limitations in the data that's currently available on pedestrian access to roads, and what can be done to improve and add to that data.

The data directory in this repo contains the input and output data from my mechanical turk job, as well as some miscellaneous things like the helper script I used to generate my street view data points, and the CartoCSS style used for my base map.
